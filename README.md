# poptracker-docker
A very basic Docker image/file that runs [Poptracker](https://github.com/black-sliver/PopTracker) inside of a web browser. 

By default, it installs the [Wind Waker Pack](https://github.com/Mysteryem/ww-poptracker) as that is the game I want to play. In the future more packs may be added.
